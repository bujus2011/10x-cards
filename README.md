# 10xCards

## Project Description

10xCards is a web application designed for automatically generating flashcards using LLMs. It streamlines the process of creating high-quality flashcards from user-provided text, making learning more efficient and engaging. Users can generate flashcards automatically with AI or create and manage them manually.

## Project Scope

The project aims to simplify flashcard creation by:

- Automatically generating flashcards using AI based on user-provided text.
- Allowing manual creation, editing, and management of flashcards.
- Supporting user account registration, login, and secure authentication using Supabase.
- Integrating with a spaced-repetition algorithm to optimize learning.
- Collecting usage statistics to assess the efficiency and quality of generated flashcards.

This MVP is designed to onboard 100 active users within the first three months and will evolve based on user feedback.

## Project Status

The project is currently in the MVP stage and under active development.
