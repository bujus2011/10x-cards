/**
 * Protected Route: Generate Flashcards
 * 
 * This page is protected by TWO layers of authentication:
 * 
 * 1. MIDDLEWARE LEVEL (src/middleware/index.ts)
 *    - Validates user session via Supabase JWT token
 *    - Redirects unauthenticated users to /auth/login
 *    - Runs on every request before reaching this page
 * 
 * 2. PAGE LEVEL (this file)
 *    - Defensive check to ensure user data exists in locals
 *    - Provides graceful fallback and error handling
 *    - Serves as a safety net in case middleware is bypassed
 * 
 * Architecture: Fail-secure design pattern
 * If either layer fails, the user cannot access this page
 */

// Defensive check: Verify user exists in locals (set by middleware)
const user = Astro.locals.user;

// Guard clause: Redirect to login if user is not authenticated
// This should rarely execute if middleware is working correctly,
// but provides defense-in-depth security
if (!user) {
  // Log security event (in production, log to monitoring service)
  console.warn("[SECURITY] Unauthorized access attempt to /generate detected");
  return Astro.redirect("/auth/login");
}

// Validate user object has required properties
if (!user.id || !user.email) {
  console.error("[SECURITY] User object is malformed in locals");
