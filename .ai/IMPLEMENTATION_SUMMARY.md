# Implementation Summary: My Flashcards Feature

## 🎯 Project Goal

Create a comprehensive "My Flashcards" view with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to manually manage their personal flashcard collection.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Backend - Service Layer** (`src/lib/flashcard.service.ts`)

Enhanced the `FlashcardService` class with four new methods:

- **`getByUserId(userId: string)`** - Retrieves all flashcards for a user
- **`getById(id: number, userId: string)`** - Retrieves a single flashcard by ID
- **`update(id: number, userId: string, updates: FlashcardUpdateDto)`** - Updates a flashcard
- **`delete(id: number, userId: string)`** - Deletes a flashcard

All methods include:

- Proper error handling with `DatabaseError` exceptions
- User authorization checks (ensuring users can only access their own flashcards)
- TypeScript type safety

### 2. **Backend - API Endpoints** (`src/pages/api/flashcards.ts`)

Expanded the flashcards API endpoint with multiple HTTP methods:

#### GET /api/flashcards

- Returns all flashcards for authenticated user
- 401 Unauthorized if not authenticated

#### POST /api/flashcards (existing)

- Creates new flashcards with validation

#### PUT /api/flashcards (new)

- Updates existing flashcard
- Validates input with Zod schema
- Returns updated flashcard

#### DELETE /api/flashcards (new)

- Deletes a flashcard
- Requires flashcard ID in request body
- Returns success response

All endpoints include:

- Authentication checks
- Zod schema validation
- Comprehensive error handling
- JSON responses

### 3. **Frontend - React Components**

#### **MyFlashcardsView.tsx** (Main Component)

- Fetches flashcards on component mount
- Real-time search/filter functionality
- Manages loading and error states
- Handles CRUD operations through API calls
- Features:
  - Loading skeleton display
  - Error notification with retry button
  - Empty state messages
  - Search bar with visual feedback
  - Responsive grid layout

#### **FlashcardCard.tsx** (Display Component)

- Beautiful card-based display
- Interactive flip animation (click to toggle front/back)
- Inline edit mode
- Quick actions:
  - Copy to clipboard
  - Edit
  - Delete
- Display formatted creation date
- Character count during editing
- Toast notifications for all actions

#### **CreateFlashcardForm.tsx** (Form Component)

- Collapsible form interface
- Front and back text input with live character count
- Validation:
  - Front: max 200 characters
  - Back: max 500 characters
  - Non-empty validation
- Cancel button
- Loading state handling

### 4. **Frontend - Main Page** (`src/pages/my-flashcards.astro`)

New Astro page with:

- Authentication check (redirects to login if not authenticated)
- Beautiful header with description
- Integrates `MyFlashcardsView` component
- Responsive layout
- Uses `Layout` component for consistent styling

### 5. **Navigation Updates** (`src/components/Navbar.tsx`)

Added "My Flashcards" link to navigation bar:

- Appears after "Generate" link
- Consistent styling with other navigation items
- Links to `/my-flashcards` route

### 6. **Route Protection** (`src/middleware/index.ts`)

Updated middleware configuration:

- Added `/my-flashcards` to protected routes
- Ensures only authenticated users can access the feature
- Automatic redirect to login for unauthenticated users

- High contrast colors

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Authentication**: All routes and API endpoints require authentication
2. **Authorization**: Users can only access their own flashcards (enforced via `user_id`)
3. **Input Validation**: Zod schemas validate all user input
4. **Error Handling**: Safe error messages without exposing system details
5. **CORS Protection**: Built-in through Supabase configuration

## 📊 Data Flow

```
User navigates to /my-flashcards
    ↓
Middleware checks authentication
    ↓
Page component mounts MyFlashcardsView
    ↓
MyFlashcardsView calls GET /api/flashcards
    ↓
API fetches user's flashcards from database
    ↓
Flashcards displayed in responsive grid
    ↓
User can:
  - Create: POST /api/flashcards
  - Read: Displayed on page
  - Update: PUT /api/flashcards
  - Delete: DELETE /api/flashcards
```
